cannyed_image = cv2.Canny(gray_image, 250, 490)

lines = cv2.HoughLinesP(
    cropped_canny,
    rho=4,
    theta=np.pi / 40,
    threshold=140,
    lines=np.array([]),
    minLineLength=50,
    maxLineGap=25
)
print(lines)
now change the threshold1 to 250 and threshold2 to 490
add print lines to Check if any lines are detected by Hough transform
